  <div><h4>1.1 About the Documentation</h4></div>
  <dd>The intended purpose of the documentation is to explain the main features of TextMate and to highlight features
    that may not be obvious to first time users. The documentation is not exhaustive.
    You should have a good understanding of what a text editor is, in particular you should have some experience with
    Cocoa's text edit control (used in TextEdit, Mail and Xcode). While TextMate does not use that control, it does
    mimic its behavior for the most part.
    If you want to print this documentation then here is a printable version.</dd>

  <div><h4>1.2 Philosophy of TextMate</h4></div>
  <dd>From UNIX we get that Tasks and Trends Change. In concrete terms this means that instead of writing a command (in
    UNIX) to solve the problem at hand, we find the underlying pattern, write a command to solve problems of that type
    and then use that command in a script.
    This gives us a command which we can re-use in the future for multiple problems of the same type. Since it is
    generally much easier (and more flexible) to piece together a script of different commands than it is to write a
    specific command the increase in productivity can be very large. This is especially true since we do not actually
    write the command in the first place, we use an existing command that has already been written for this type of
    problem.</dd>

  <div><h4>2.2 Find and Replace in Projects</h4></div>
  <ul> Using Edit → Find → Find in Project…(⇧⌘F) will bring up the window shown below.
    <li>Find In Project. From here it is possible to search all (text) files in the current project and do replacements.
    </li>
    <li>After pressing Find it is possible to either press Replace All, or select which matches should be replaced, in
      which case the Replace All button will change to Replace Selected.</li>
    <li>Currently it is not possible to limit the scope of the search to anything other than all text files in the full
      project.</li>
    <li>As a workaround, when you want to search only a subset of your project, you can select the files you want to
      search in the project drawer and drag the selection to the TextMate application icon to create a new scratch
      project. A find/replace can then be performed on that project, which can then be closed.</li>

  <dd><p>TextMate tries for the most part to mimic the behavior of the NSTextView system component, as used by applications
    such as Mail, Safari and basically all other Cocoa applications. 
    Some of the extra features related to text editing are covered in this section.</p></dd>

  <div><h4>4.1 Auto-Paired Characters (Quotes etc.)</h4></div>
  <dd><dl><p>When writing structured text (like markup or source code) there are characters which go together in pairs.
   <dt>For example in a programming language</dt>
    <dd>you rarely type an opening brace ({) without also needing the closing brace (}).</dd>
    <dd>To help you keep these characters balanced, TextMate will insert the appropriate closing character after the
      caret when you type the opening one.</dd>
    <dd>If you type the closing character TextMate is smart enough to overwrite the auto-inserted one.</dd>
    <dd>If you type an opening character and then delete it using backward delete (⌫) then the auto-inserted character
      will also be deleted. If you only want to delete the auto-inserted character, use forward delete instead (⌦).
  <dt>It is also possible to wrap a selection in an open/close character by selecting text and typing the opening character.</dt>
    <dd> For example if you type foo, select it and type ( then TextMate will make it (foo) placing the caret after the
      ending parentheses.</dd>
    <dt> The actual character pairs are defined in the bundle preferences with different settings for different
      languages and contexts. </dt>
    <dd>For example, in source code an apostrophe is set up to have itself as a closing character, except for comments
      and strings. This is achieved using scope selectors.</dd>
    <dt>Two useful shortcuts in relation to auto-paired characters (defined as macros in the Source bundle and
      overridden for a few languages) are: ⌘↩ Move to the end of the line and insert a newline.</dt>
    <dd>For example if you write: print("foo Then you will have ") to the right of the caret and can now use ⌘↩ to skip
      these two characters and insert a new line. ⇧⌘↩ Move to the end of the line, insert a ; and then insert a newline.
    </dd></dl></dd>

  <div><h4>4.2 Completion</h4></div>
  <dd>TextMate has a simple yet effective completion function on ⎋ (escape). It will complete the current word based on
    matches in the current document. If there are multiple matches, you can cycle through these by pressing ⎋
    continuously. It is also possible to cycle backwards using ⇧⎋.
    The matches are sorted by distance from the caret, meaning candidates which are closer to the caret will be
    suggested before candidates farther away.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.3 Copy and Paste</h4></div>

  <div><h4>4.3.1 Clipboard History</h4></div>
  <dd>Each time you copy or cut text, the text is pushed onto a stack.
    By pressing ⌃⌥⌘V you will see the list of all previous clippings and can pick the one you want to paste using arrow
    keys. Use return to insert it and escape to dismiss the list. If you dismiss the list, the currently selected
    clipping will be what gets pasted the next time you use the paste function.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.3.2 Re-indented Paste</h4></div>
  <dd> When pasting text, TextMate will estimate the indent of the text pasted as well as the current indent level and
    adjust the pasted text so that it matches the current indent.
    The estimates are done using the indentation rules mentioned in the Re-Indent Text section.
    If you temporarily want to avoid this you can paste text using ⌃⌘V. You can also permanently disable re-indented
    pasting in the Text Editing part of the Preferences.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.4 Editing Modes</h4></div>

  <div><h4>4.4.1 Freehanded Editing</h4></div>
  <dd>You can enable or disable freehanded editing in the Edit → Mode submenu (⌥⌘E).
    With this mode enabled caret movement will not be restricted by line endings or tab stops.
    This is useful when working with ASCII diagrams, when inserting something at a given column on several lines (and
    you do not want to insert the padding) and in a few other situations.
    When making column selections freehanded mode is (temporarily) enabled, allowing you to make selections past the end
    of lines.
    It is also possible to place the caret beyond the end of a line by single-clicking the mouse while holding down the
    option key (⌥).</dd>

  <div><h4>4.4.2 Overwrite Mode</h4></div>
  <dl><dd>By enabling overwrite mode in the Edit → Mode submenu (⌥⌘O) characters already in the document will be overwritten
    as you type rather than inserted as normal.
  <dl>This is useful when working with column data, e.g.:
  <dd>foo</dd>
  <dd>jaz</dd>
  <dd>bar</dd>
  <dd>sub</dd>
  <dd>fud</dd>
  <dd>dub</dd>
  Imagine we want to overwrite some of the values in the first column. Somewhat similarly, we may have a line of a fixed
  width and want to replace part of it but preserve the width, for example we could have code like this where we must
  right-align the value to column 20 but want to overwrite the label:
  printf("Value is %3d", 37).</p></dd></dl>

  <div><h4>4.5 Find and Replace</h4></div>
  <dd>In addition to the standard find dialog, TextMate has a Find submenu (located in the Edit menu) which gives you key
    equivalents for find and replace actions.
    Find Menu</dd>

  <div><h4>4.6 Moving Text</h4></div>

  <div><h4>4.6.1 Increase/Decrease Indent Level</h4></div>
  <dd>In the Text menu there is a Shift Left and Shift Right action bound to ⌘[ and ⌘]. These will increase and decrease
    the indent by the size of one tab.
    On many european key layouts these keys are rather awkward, so in addition to these, you can also use ⌥⇥ and ⌥⇤
    (where ⇤ is achieved using ⇧⇥).</dd>

  <div><h4>4.6.2 Move Text Up/Down/Left/Right</h4></div>
  <dd>If you want to move a line/block up/down a few lines or move a word/column selection, it can be done by holding
    down ⌃⌘ and using the arrow keys to move the selection around. It also works for moving lines up/down without a
    selection.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.6.3 Re-indent Text</h4></div>
  <dd>If you have code which has broken indent, you can select it and use Text → Indent Selection (without a selection it
    indents the current line).
    The rules for estimating the indent are setup per-language using bundle preferences. For more details see the
    indentation rules section.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.7 Selecting Text</h4></div>
  <dd>Selecting text is achieved by holding down ⇧ while using the normal movement keys. In addition the Edit → Select
    submenu has actions to select current word, line, paragraph, enclosing brackets and entire document.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.7.1 Editing Multiple Lines</h4></div>
  <dd>Sometimes there is a need for adding a suffix to lines of variable length, or maybe editing the last part of these
    lines.
    Although you can use find and replace for this, an easier way is to select the lines that needs to be edited, then
    use Text → Edit Each Line in Selection (⌥⌘A) and the caret will be placed at the end of the first line in the
    selection.
    You can now type new text, delete text or go back and edit existing text and this will be mirrored down through all
    the (previously selected) lines. To leave this mode, simply move the caret away from the current line.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.7.2 Column Selections</h4></div>

  <div><h4>4.8 Column Movement / Typing</h4></div>
  <dd><p>Using arrow up/down with ⌥ will move the caret to the first/last row in the current column. Hold down ⇧ to get it
    selected.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Column Data <dd>For example if you have column data as shown above with the caret in front of foo, press ⌥⇧↓ and it
      will move the caret down in front of fud and leave the text between foo and fud selected.</dd></dt>
    <dt>Column Movement <dd>You may now either want to press ⌥ once to switch to a zero-width column selection, then start
      typing to type on each line.</dd></dt>
    <dt>Column Typing <dd>Alternatively use ⌥⇧→ and then ⌥ to leave the entire column selected (in column mode).</dd></dt>
    <dt>Column Selection</dt>
  </dl></dd>

  <div><h4>4.9 Smart Tab Behavior</h4></div>
  <dd>When using the tab key at the beginning of a line, TextMate will insert as many tabs as it estimates to be correct
    for that line. If the line already has text the caret will move to the front of this text.
    If the line already has the correct indent (or above) a single tab will be inserted.</dd>

  <div><h4>4.10 Spell Checking</h4></div>
  <dd>TextMate supports the system wide 'Check Spelling as You Type'. This can be changed in the Edit → Spelling submenu.
    You can bring up the context sensitive menu for a misspelled word to get spelling suggestions.
    Since TextMate is intended for structured text it is possible to exclude parts of the document from being checked.
    This is done by creating a preferences item in the bundle editor, setting spellChecking to 0 and filling in the
    scope selector with the selector to target for no spell checking.
    By default spell checking is disabled for source code except strings and comments and also for keywords, tags and
    similar in HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, etc.</dd>
